It comes after the spectacle of incandescent lava spewing from the volcano last Sunday for the first time in 38 years has attracted thousands of visitors to the city of Hilo.     But now, the molten rock could make the road impassable and force drivers to find alternative coastal routes in the north and south, adding hours to commute times.       Image:  People gather to observe the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii     The lava is oozing slowly at a rate that may reach the road next week, but its unpredictable path might change course or the flow could stop completely and spare the highway. US Geological Survey scientists said the slow-moving flow was coursing around 2.7 miles (4.3km) from the road on Friday.       Earlier this week, the state Department of Transportation took steps to remove potential traffic obstacles on the northern coastal route by reopening a lane across Nanue Bridge that was closed for repairs. Geologists from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said if Mauna Loa follows historical patterns, the eruption is expected to continue for one to two weeks.

They noted that restricted access could affect emergency services as one of the island\\'s primary hospitals is on the east side. Meanwhile, hotels in and around Hilo are getting fully booked in what is usually a slower time of the year for business, while helicopter tours of Mauna Loa are also in high demand since the eruption.

The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is typically quiet for Hawaii\\'s travel industry, but this week thousands of cars have caused traffic jams on Route 200, known as the Saddle Road, which connects the cities of Hilo on the east side of Hawaii Island and Kailua-Kona on the west side.
